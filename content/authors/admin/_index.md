Welcome. 

I am an applied economist and data scientist at [SWICA Health Insurance](https://swica.ch) and at the [Swiss Institute for Empirical Research](https://sew.unisg.ch/) of the University of St. Gallen. 

My research lies at the intersection of health and education economics. As an education economist, I am particularly interested in the situation of students from minority groups (such as [gifted students](http://jhr.uwpress.org/content/early/2021/02/03/jhr.58.4.0920-11170R1.full.pdf+html) or [students with special needs](https://drive.google.com/file/d/107Nj2l3LgDpGxCkFDXnll7oCCeZ-Yz4c/view)) in inclusive educational settings. 

When not coding or writing, you'll find me [running or biking](https://www.strava.com/athletes/14815281), cooking, baking sourdough bread, or collaborating on the [Intergifted project](https://www.intergifted.com).
